Each folder is an OpenGL project to demonstrate the following techniques in Graphical Image Rendering:
1.  A simple Hello World to set up the environment for rendering
2. Shading
3. Transformations
4. Texture Mapping
5. Render Buffer
6. Environment Mapping

The final project folder demonstrates different Non-PhotoRealistic rendering approaches including:
1. Toon Shading
2. Gooch Shading
3. Hatching

Each project folder contains a pdf with detailed description about the project, its implementation, challenges faced, how to run the code and some screenshots of the working code.
